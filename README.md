# Introduction

Counterfeit products are goods of inferior quality that are manufactured and distributed under another brand's name without the brand owner's authorization. Sellers of counterfeit products profit by infringing on the trademark, patent or copyright of the brand owner by passing off its goods as made by the brand owner. 

In 2018, Forbes reported that counterfeiting was the largest criminal enterprise in the world. Sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totals $1.7 trillion per year, which is more than drugs and human trafficking. It is expected to grow to $2.8 trillion and cost 5.4 million jobs by 2022. 

According to The Counterfeit Report, "China produces 80% of the world's counterfeits and we're supporting China. Whether or not it's their intention to completely undermine and destroy the U.S. economy, we [in the United States] buy about 60% to 80% of the products." It states:

Companies spend millions or billions of dollars building brands, and building reputations and they're being completely destroyed by counterfeits. And when you take that across a universe of goods, Americans' confidence in their own products is nonexistent. Retailers, the malls, the retail stores are closing up, and we're becoming a duopoly of Walmart and Amazon.

In addition to the economic growth of legitimate business, the production and trafficking of counterfeit products poses a significant health and safety threat to consumers. 

“Counterfeit products not only attack the name and value of a known business, but, in many cases, can cause harmful, and sometimes fatal, consequences for the unsuspecting buyer,” said Mark Zito, Deputy Special Agent in Charge for HSI Los Angeles.

Some of the most dangerous counterfeit products involve automotive parts, electronics, safety equipment, cosmetics and prescription drugs due to the threats they represent to public health and safety.  Examples include: 
* Counterfeit airbags and their components can cause severe malfunctions ranging from non-deployment, under inflation, over inflation to explosion of metal shrapnel during deployment in a crash.
* Counterfeit lithium-ion laptop batteries pose significant risk of extreme heat, self-igniting, and exploding.
* Counterfeit helmets and baby carriers can break.
* Counterfeit prescription drugs may not contain the active ingredient or could lead to accidental overdose.
* Counterfeit cosmetics can cause severe skin reactions.

#TODO Elaborate. 

Everyone wants to get rich off NFTs, many are creating NFTs, some are trading NFTs, but a very small percentage comprehend what an NFT really is.

### What is an NFT? (for non-technical readers)

![nft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95597283/172121312-3a35285f-1539-49c2-984f-e8e4d85d7193.jpg)

An NFT is a non-fungible token which means that each token is unique and not interchangeable. NFTs are minted (issued) on a decentralized distributed-ledger technology (DLT) network that is neither controlled nor dependent on one single centralized instance. 

An NFT is controlled only by the person holding the private keys to the address to which an NFT is assigned in the smart contract ledger and are freely transferable within and outside various metaverses and marketplaces.

### Major Brand Adoption of the Metaverse

#### Coke 

In July 2021, and in observance of the Special Olympics, the soft drink behemoth teamed up with 3-D digital design studio Tafi for its inaugural NFT campaign. The campaign centered around “loot boxes,” which were basically virtual goodie bags that contained a variety of one-of-one digital assets — including a branded puffer jacket wearable NFT, a “sound visualizer” NFT (which “captures the experience of sharing a Coca-Cola”), and a “friendship card” NFT (a digital revival of the brand’s famous 1940s trading cards). Blending utility with nostalgia, Coca-Cola’s debut NFT drop is an iconic case study for brands that are looking to ingratiate themselves with the metaverse.

#### Nike

Nikeland was one of the first major efforts from a top-tier brand to blend sales, marketing, and gaming. It also provided a virtual showroom where visitors could flaunt their avatars’ new virtual Nike gear. As a whole, Nikeland has helped to prove the huge commercial value of the metaverse while simultaneously proving that a huge number of fans are genuinely keen on branded experiences in virtual environments.

#### Gucci

in 2021 — in celebration of its one hundredth anniversary — it launched the “Gucci Garden Archetypes,” a two-week virtual experience “that explores and celebrates the house’s inimitable creative vision,” Gucci said in a statement at the time. And just last week, the brand launched “Gucci Town,” also hosted on Roblox, which has been designed to be a virtual rendering of Vault (its concept store), as well as a space for visitors to “come together with friends.” Each of these efforts represents Gucci’s commitment to doing everything that it can to remain one step ahead of its competitors as technology and pop culture continue to evolve.  

#### Adidas 

Adidas made Web3 history when it launched “Into the Metaverse,” a NFT drop created in partnership with NFT companies Gmoney, Punks Comic, and Bored Ape Yacht Club in late 2021. To date, Adidas has been able to effectively leverage the NFT marketplace and the metaverse to promote the ethos of individuality and self-expression that the brand has long pushed for in its traditional marketing. “We've embarked on the new age of originality, we said from the very beginning that if we're going to be the brand that’s going to stand for, represent and help push the values of this new generation into the world, then we must move at the speed of culture,” Erika Wykes-Sneyd, Adidas’ vice president of brand communications, said in a statement from December 2021, around the launch of “Into the Metaverse.” “This goes back to the principles of Adidas, where we embrace the edge, open the door for the new and act with rebellious optimism.”

### Introducing pepperMint(): A Real World Implementation of Non Fungible Tokens 

pepperMint() is an implementation of NFT technology in the real world, as opposed to the metaverse, whereby counterfeit products are known to cause significant harm to businesses and consumers globally. 

NFTs can be used to verify the authenticity of physical goods by storing all relevant information relating to a product in an NFT on a decentralized network.  The successful use of the technology is based on how the product to be protected can be connected to the DLT. pepperMint() achieves product protection with the use of QR codes in the NFT minting process. 

#### Case Study: Breitling Designer Watches

Since 13 October 2020, all new Breitling watches are delivered with a blockchain based digital passport to guarantee the products authenticity. Consumers are afforded the benefit of blockchain technology, digital security and proof of ownership.
