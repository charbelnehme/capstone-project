# Problem Overview 

Counterfeit products are goods of inferior quality that are manufactured and distributed under another brand's name without the brand owner's authorization. Sellers of counterfeit products profit by infringing on the trademark, patent or copyright of the brand owner by passing off its goods as made by the brand owner. 

In 2018, Forbes reported that counterfeiting was the largest criminal enterprise in the world. Sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totals $1.7 trillion per year, which is more than drugs and human trafficking. It is expected to grow to $2.8 trillion and cost 5.4 million jobs by 2022. 

According to The Counterfeit Report, "China produces 80% of the world's counterfeits and we're supporting China. Whether or not it's their intention to completely undermine and destroy the U.S. economy, we [in the United States] buy about 60% to 80% of the products." It states:

Companies spend millions or billions of dollars building brands, and building reputations and they're being completely destroyed by counterfeits. And when you take that across a universe of goods, Americans' confidence in their own products is nonexistent. Retailers, the malls, the retail stores are closing up, and we're becoming a duopoly of Walmart and Amazon.

In addition to the economic growth of legitimate business, the production and trafficking of counterfeit products poses a significant health and safety threat to consumers. 

“Counterfeit products not only attack the name and value of a known business, but, in many cases, can cause harmful, and sometimes fatal, consequences for the unsuspecting buyer,” said Mark Zito, Deputy Special Agent in Charge for HSI Los Angeles.

Some of the most dangerous counterfeit products involve automotive parts, electronics, safety equipment, cosmetics and prescription drugs due to the threats they represent to public health and safety.  Examples include: 
* Counterfeit airbags and their components can cause severe malfunctions ranging from non-deployment, under inflation, over inflation to explosion of metal shrapnel during deployment in a crash.
* Counterfeit lithium-ion laptop batteries pose significant risk of extreme heat, self-igniting, and exploding.
* Counterfeit helmets and baby carriers can break.
* Counterfeit prescription drugs may not contain the active ingredient or could lead to accidental overdose.
* Counterfeit cosmetics can cause severe skin reactions.

### What is an NFT? (for non-technical readers)

An NFT is a non-fungible token which means that each token is unique and not interchangeable. NFTs are minted (issued) on a decentralized distributed-ledger technology (DLT) network that is neither controlled nor dependent on one single centralized instance. 

An NFT is controlled only by the person holding the private keys to the address to which an NFT is assigned in the smart contract ledger and are freely transferable within and outside various metaverses and marketplaces.

pepperMint() is an implementation of NFT technology in the real world, as opposed to the metaverse, whereby counterfeit products are known to cause significant harm to businesses and consumers globally. 

NFTs can be used to verify the authenticity of physical goods by storing all relevant information relating to a product in an NFT on a decentralized network.  The successful use of the technology is based on how the product to be protected can be connected to the DLT. pepperMint() achieves product protection with the use of QR codes in the NFT minting process.
